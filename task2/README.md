## Usage

```

```

## Technologies used

- React
- React Hooks
- Fetch
- CSS
- BEM
- HTML/JSX

## Would have like to add...

- Designer Filter (partially started, in the product-filter branch of the repository)
- Testing for product rendering and data fetch using Jest and Enzyme
- Error handling for fetch request and add loading states
- Using styled-components to create more re-usable code

#### This was so so much fun to build! I wish I had more time to spend on it but I hope this provides some indication of my approach.
