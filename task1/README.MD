# Farfetch Code Test - Task One

## Description

A html email based on the module design provided and list of products in task1.ftl.

## Approach
Though the original task suggested using ftl, it wasn't a language I had encountered previously and though it may be best to create html initially. I'd have rather spent the time ensuring the email was robust, however I am keen to learn FreeMarker!

## Installation/Usage

Open index.html in browser

## Technologies used

- HTML
- CSS
